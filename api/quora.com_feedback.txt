I spoke with the customer service team after the second order not delivered and they said that they have made a note that the courier company will be changed to ensure proper delivery but nothing happened and again they failed to deliver.

Huge disappointment and I decided not to place order with Amazon anymore.

What are the stupidest money mistakes most people make?

Where do I start?

I’m a huge financial nerd, and have spent an embarrassing amount of time talking to people about their money habits.

Here are the biggest mistakes people are making and how to fix them:

Not having a separate high interest savings account

Having a separate account allows you to see the results of all your hard work and keep your money separate so you're less tempted to spend it.

Plus with rates above 5.00%, the interest you can earn compared to most banks really adds up.

Overpaying on car insurance

You’ve heard it a million times before, but the average American family still overspends by $417/year on car insurance.

If you’ve been with the same insurer for years, chances are you are one of them.

Pull up [Coverage.com](https://www.myfinance.com/reporting/32350533/?mf_utm_campaign=savingspro2-auto-insurance-flow-link&s1=Q_Mult_DT1&s2=%7BCLICK_ID%7D&qclid=1742769742032233243%7C211106241156263%7C0 "www.myfinance.com"), a free site that will compare prices for you, answer the questions on the page, and it will show you how much you could be saving.

That’s it. You’ll likely be saving a bunch of money. [Here’s a link to give it a try](https://www.myfinance.com/reporting/32350533/?mf_utm_campaign=savingspro2-auto-insurance-flow-link&s1=Q_Mult_DT1&s2=%7BCLICK_ID%7D&qclid=1742769742032233243%7C211106241156263%7C0 "www.myfinance.com").

Consistently being in debt

If you’ve got $10K+ in debt (credit cards…medical bills…anything really) you could use a [debt relief program](https://www.bankrate.com/landing/savingspro/best-debt-relief-options/?sub-id=Q_Multi_DT1&s2=%7BCLICK_ID%7D&qclid=1742769742032233243%7C211106241156263%7C0 "www.bankrate.com") and potentially reduce by over 20%.

Here’s how to see if you qualify:

Head over to this Debt Relief comparison website [here](https://www.bankrate.com/landing/savingspro/best-debt-relief-options/?sub-id=Q_Multi_DT1&s2=%7BCLICK_ID%7D&qclid=1742769742032233243%7C211106241156263%7C0 "www.bankrate.com"), then simply answer the questions to see if you qualify.

It’s as simple as that. You’ll likely end up paying less than you owed before and you could be debt free in as little as 2 years.

Missing out on free money to invest

It’s no secret that millionaires love investing, but for the rest of us, it can seem out of reach.

Times have changed. There are a number of [investing platforms](https://savingspro.org/the-best-ways-for-to-invest/?sub-id=Q_Multi_DT1&s2=%7BCLICK_ID%7D&qclid=1742769742032233243%7C211106241156263%7C0 "savingspro.org") that will give you a bonus to open an account and get started. All you have to do is open the account and invest at least $25, and you could get up to $1000 in bonus.

Pretty sweet deal right? Here is a [link](https://savingspro.org/the-best-ways-for-to-invest/?sub-id=Q_Multi_DT1&s2=%7BCLICK_ID%7D&qclid=1742769742032233243%7C211106241156263%7C0 "savingspro.org") to some of the best options.

Having bad credit

A low credit score can come back to bite you in so many ways in the future.

From that next rental application to getting approved for any type of loan or credit card, if you have a bad history with credit, the good news is you can fix it.

Head over to [BankRate.com](https://www.bankrate.com/landing/savingspro/credit-repair/?sub-id=Q_Multi_DT1&s2=%7BCLICK_ID%7D&qclid=1742769742032233243%7C211106241156263%7C0 "www.bankrate.com") and answer a few questions to see if you qualify. It only takes a few minutes and could save you from a major upset down the line.

How to get started

Hope this helps! Here are the links to get started:

[Have a separate savings account](https://savingspro.org/savings-rates/?sub-id=Q_Sav_DT1&s2=%7BCLICK_ID%7D&qclid=1742769742032233243%7C211106241156263%7C0 "savingspro.org")

When I track delivery daily after 10 pm they are saying it will be delivered tomorrow.

Again I receive the same message since last 3-4 days.

On chat they are saying sorry. No one gives the exact resolution.

On call they talk like politicians.

Worst than worst. Total harassment. On the top they are asking for feedback.

Just received the following message.

"We are very sorry your delivery is late. We apologize for the inconvenience.""

Very good to excellent….

Most of the time, they solve the issue immediately. A few times, a follow up email is needed. I use email and get the problem resolved in a few hours.

What is the best project management tool?

I might be a little biased, but as an Asana employee, I believe Asana is the best project management tool. With Asana, my entire team has a central source of truth so they know exactly who’s doing what by when. We can track all of our tasks and stay aligned on our team goals. This has been especially important recently, since it’s enabled our team to manage shifting priorities and take any new challenges in stride.

I might be a little biased, but as an Asana employee, I believe Asana is the best project management tool. With Asana, my entire team has a central source of truth so they know exactly who’s doing what by when. We can track all of our tasks and stay aligned on our team goals. This has been especially important recently, since it’s enabled our team to manage shifting priorities and take any new challenges in stride.

Every team is different, so your team might not use Asana exactly like my team does. But every team can benefit from more clarity, coordination, and collaboration at work. Here are five reasons why Asana is the best project management tool for your team:

1\. Quickly get started and get organized

Spend your time doing skilled work—not getting set up. With Asana’s [CSV importer](https://asana.com/apps/csv-importer?utm_source=quora&utm_medium=pd_cpc&utm_campaign=Conversion%20%7C%20NAMER%20%7C%20Prospecting%20%7C%20Promoted%20Answer%20%7C%20US&utm_content=Promoted_answer_best%20PM%20tool&utm_term=US%7CBehavioral-Interest%7CDesktop&qclid=1742769742032233243%7C211106240966738%7C0 "asana.com"), you can import your current project data from whatever spreadsheet or system you have into Asana in minutes. Here’s a 1-minute video on how.

Or, if you don’t have a process you currently use, you can also use one of Asana’s 50+ pre-built [templates](https://asana.com/resources/project-plan-templates?utm_source=quora&utm_medium=pd_cpc&utm_campaign=Conversion%20%7C%20NAMER%20%7C%20Prospecting%20%7C%20Promoted%20Answer%20%7C%20US&utm_content=Promoted_answer_best%20PM%20tool&utm_term=US%7CBehavioral-Interest%7CDesktop&qclid=1742769742032233243%7C211106240966738%7C0 "asana.com") to jumpstart your work.

2\. Manage all of your work with flexible views

In order for your project management tool to be your team’s central source of truth, it has to work for everyone. Individual contributors need to be able to dive into details, managers need to easily gauge [team bandwidth](https://asana.com/product/workload?utm_source=quora&utm_medium=pd_cpc&utm_campaign=Conversion%20%7C%20NAMER%20%7C%20Prospecting%20%7C%20Promoted%20Answer%20%7C%20US&utm_content=Promoted_answer_best%20PM%20tool&utm_term=US%7CBehavioral-Interest%7CDesktop&qclid=1742769742032233243%7C211106240966738%7C0 "asana.com") and spot bottlenecks, and senior leaders need a [high-level view](https://asana.com/product/portfolios?utm_source=quora&utm_medium=pd_cpc&utm_campaign=Conversion%20%7C%20NAMER%20%7C%20Prospecting%20%7C%20Promoted%20Answer%20%7C%20US&utm_content=Promoted_answer_best%20PM%20tool&utm_term=US%7CBehavioral-Interest%7CDesktop&qclid=1742769742032233243%7C211106240966738%7C0 "asana.com") of how projects are progressing.

Every project in Asana has four views, so every member of your team can find what they need:

- List View: A linear grid view that provides at-a-glance insight into who’s doing what by when.
- Board View: A kanban board view so you can visualize each stage of work and manage [agile](https://asana.com/uses/agile-management?utm_source=quora&utm_medium=pd_cpc&utm_campaign=Conversion%20%7C%20NAMER%20%7C%20Prospecting%20%7C%20Promoted%20Answer%20%7C%20US&utm_content=Promoted_answer_best%20PM%20tool&utm_term=US%7CBehavioral-Interest%7CDesktop&qclid=1742769742032233243%7C211106240966738%7C0 "asana.com") teams.
- Calendar View: A customizable calendar where you can see all tasks in a project and set and adjust due dates.
- Timeline View: A Gantt-chart style view so you can see how work maps out over time, avoid overlap, and easily identify [dependencies](https://asana.com/product/timeline?utm_source=quora&utm_medium=pd_cpc&utm_campaign=Conversion%20%7C%20NAMER%20%7C%20Prospecting%20%7C%20Promoted%20Answer%20%7C%20US&utm_content=Promoted_answer_best%20PM%20tool&utm_term=US%7CBehavioral-Interest%7CDesktop&qclid=1742769742032233243%7C211106240966738%7C0 "asana.com").

![](https://qph.cf2.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-cbebf49110cd00db2b568de7c474629d-pjlq)

3\. Track and report on progress

The average employee uses [10 different tools per day](https://asana.com/resources/anatomy-of-work?utm_source=quora&utm_medium=pd_cpc&utm_campaign=Conversion%20%7C%20NAMER%20%7C%20Prospecting%20%7C%20Promoted%20Answer%20%7C%20US&utm_content=Promoted_answer_best%20PM%20tool&utm_term=US%7CBehavioral-Interest%7CDesktop&qclid=1742769742032233243%7C211106240966738%7C0 "asana.com"). The app switching is not only exhausting, but it also means information is scattered and difficult to find. Your team shouldn’t have to dig through 10 tools in order to find the information or context they need in order to be successful.

With Asana, you have easy access to all the tracking and reporting features you need:

- [Status updates](https://blog.asana.com/2020/05/introducing-status-for-remote-work/?utm_source=quora&utm_medium=pd_cpc&utm_campaign=Conversion%20%7C%20NAMER%20%7C%20Prospecting%20%7C%20Promoted%20Answer%20%7C%20US&utm_content=Promoted_answer_best%20PM%20tool&utm_term=US%7CBehavioral-Interest%7CDesktop&qclid=1742769742032233243%7C211106240966738%7C0 "blog.asana.com"): Keep everyone informed on the progress of your work—without scheduling recurring follow-up meetings or digging through multiple tools for updates and information.
- [Advanced Search](https://asana.com/guide/videos/search-views-chapter?utm_source=quora&utm_medium=pd_cpc&utm_campaign=Conversion%20%7C%20NAMER%20%7C%20Prospecting%20%7C%20Promoted%20Answer%20%7C%20US&utm_content=Promoted_answer_best%20PM%20tool&utm_term=US%7CBehavioral-Interest%7CDesktop&qclid=1742769742032233243%7C211106240966738%7C0 "asana.com"): Asana Advanced Search takes the parameters you remember and narrows the scope of your search results, so you can easily find exactly what you’re looking for.
- Reporting: Save an Advanced Search as a report. The report will automatically refresh to provide the most up-to-date information every time you click into it.

4\. Communicate where you work

Most teams have two totally different types of tools: content tools—like documents, spreadsheets, and team-specific software—and collaboration tools—like email, Slack, Microsoft Teams, and Zoom. But there’s a third must-have type of tool: coordination tools. Coordination tools like project management software connect all of your work. With a coordination tool like Asana, you have all of the context, feedback, and information you need—right where you’re working.

When everyone is using Asana, all of your work is centralized in one place. That means you can get easy access to all tasks and projects for a full understanding of what’s going on. Instead of digging through an email chain, you can easily search, sort, and find the task you need. Share files, leave a comment, or send an update, all where work is being done.

5\. Automate the work you hate

Today, [82% of workers report feeling burned out](https://blog.asana.com/2019/07/workload-effort/?utm_source=quora&utm_medium=pd_cpc&utm_campaign=Conversion%20%7C%20NAMER%20%7C%20Prospecting%20%7C%20Promoted%20Answer%20%7C%20US&utm_content=Promoted_answer_best%20PM%20tool&utm_term=US%7CBehavioral-Interest%7CDesktop&qclid=1742769742032233243%7C211106240966738%7C0 "blog.asana.com"), largely because of the busywork associated with checking in on progress, adjusting due dates, and assigning tasks. There’s no reason those tasks should be done manually.

Asana Rules help you automate the manual processes that get between you and your daily, high-impact work. Instead of worrying about the details, Rules can automatically assign work to the correct teammate, send stakeholders important notifications, shift due dates, and hand off work at the right time. That way, you have more time for strategic work.

Try Asana for free

There’s a sixth must-have feature to look for in a project management tool: your team should be able to try it for yourselves. Start your [free trial](https://asana.com/pricing?utm_source=quora&utm_medium=pd_cpc&utm_campaign=Conversion%20%7C%20NAMER%20%7C%20Prospecting%20%7C%20Promoted%20Answer%20%7C%20US&utm_content=Promoted_answer_best%20PM%20tool&utm_term=US%7CBehavioral-Interest%7CDesktop&qclid=1742769742032233243%7C211106240966738%7C0 "asana.com") to see how Asana helps teams organize and manage their projects, improve collaboration, work more efficiently, and hit their goals.

I think they have the best customer service executives in India, they are very polite, and gives positive response to our queries.

You may encounter a bad experience but that would be a rare case.

What are the worst things people overspend on in the U.S.?

You’ve done what you can to cut back your spending.

You brew coffee at home, you don’t walk into Target and you refuse to order avocado toast. (Can you sense my millennial sarcasm there?)

But no matter how cognizant you are of your spending habits, you’re still stuck with those inescapable monthly bills. You know which ones we’re talking about: rent, utilities, cell phone bill, insurance, groceries…

So if you’re ready to stop paying them, follow these moves…

You’ve done what you can to cut back your spending.

You brew coffee at home, you don’t walk into Target and you refuse to order avocado toast. (Can you sense my millennial sarcasm there?)

But no matter how cognizant you are of your spending habits, you’re still stuck with those inescapable monthly bills. You know which ones we’re talking about: rent, utilities, cell phone bill, insurance, groceries…

So if you’re ready to stop paying them, follow these moves…

1\. Overpriced Insurance: Cancel Your Car Insurance

You might not even realize it, but your car insurance company is probably overcharging you. In fact, they’re kind of counting on you not noticing. Luckily, this problem is easy to fix.

Don’t waste your time browsing insurance sites for a better deal. A company called [Insurify](https://t.thepennyhoarder.com/aff_ad?campaign_id=319&aff_id=114&source=overspending-desktop-quora&aff_sub3=overspending-desktop-promoted-answer&aff_sub4=%7B%7Bcampaign.id%7D%7D "t.thepennyhoarder.com") shows you all your options at once — people who do this save up to $996 per year.

If you tell them a bit about yourself and your vehicle, they’ll send you personalized quotes so you can compare them and find the best one for you.

Tired of overpaying for car insurance? It takes just five minutes to compare your options with Insurify and [t.thepennyhoarder.com](https://t.thepennyhoarder.com/aff_ad?campaign_id=319&aff_id=114&source=overspending-desktop-quora&aff_sub3=overspending-desktop-promoted-answer&aff_sub4=%7B%7Bcampaign.id%7D%7D "t.thepennyhoarder.com") [see how much you could save on car insurance.](https://t.thepennyhoarder.com/aff_ad?campaign_id=319&aff_id=114&source=overspending-desktop-quora&aff_sub3=overspending-desktop-promoted-answer&aff_sub4=%7B%7Bcampaign.id%7D%7D "t.thepennyhoarder.com")

2\. Online Shopping: If You Don’t Use This Free Tool, You’re Overpaying on Amazon

Wouldn’t it be nice if you got an alert when you’re shopping online at Amazon and are about to overpay?

That’s exactly what [t.thepennyhoarder.com](https://t.thepennyhoarder.com/aff_ad?campaign_id=298&aff_id=114&source=overspending-desktop-quora&aff_sub3=overspending-desktop-promoted-answer&aff_sub4=%7B%7Bcampaign.id%7D%7D "t.thepennyhoarder.com") [this free service](https://t.thepennyhoarder.com/aff_ad?campaign_id=298&aff_id=114&source=overspending-desktop-quora&aff_sub3=overspending-desktop-promoted-answer&aff_sub4=%7B%7Bcampaign.id%7D%7D "t.thepennyhoarder.com") does.

Just add it to your browser for free, and before you check out, it’ll check other websites to see if your item is available for cheaper. Let’s say you’re shopping for a new smart vacuum, and you assume you’ve found the best price. Here’s when you’ll get a pop up letting you know if that exact vacuum is available elsewhere for cheaper. If there are any available coupon codes, they’ll also automatically be applied to your order.

In the last year, this has saved people $800 million.

You can get started in just a few clicks to [t.thepennyhoarder.com](https://t.thepennyhoarder.com/aff_ad?campaign_id=298&aff_id=114&source=overspending-desktop-quora&aff_sub3=overspending-desktop-promoted-answer&aff_sub4=%7B%7Bcampaign.id%7D%7D "t.thepennyhoarder.com") [see if you’re overpaying online](https://t.thepennyhoarder.com/aff_ad?campaign_id=298&aff_id=114&source=overspending-desktop-quora&aff_sub3=overspending-desktop-promoted-answer&aff_sub4=%7B%7Bcampaign.id%7D%7D "t.thepennyhoarder.com").

3\. Eating Out: Earn as Much as $1K/Month Doing Simple Online Tasks

Is there such a thing as easy money? If you know your way around the web, there certainly is.

That’s because data is currency these days, and many companies are willing to pay cash for it — up to $1,000 per month.

Finding these companies can be time-consuming on your own. But a company called [t.thepennyhoarder.com](https://t.thepennyhoarder.com/aff_ad?campaign_id=316&aff_id=114&source=overspending-desktop-quora&aff_sub3=overspending-desktop-promoted-answer&aff_sub4=%7B%7Bcampaign.id%7D%7D "t.thepennyhoarder.com") [Freecash](https://t.thepennyhoarder.com/aff_ad?campaign_id=316&aff_id=114&source=overspending-desktop-quora&aff_sub3=overspending-desktop-promoted-answer&aff_sub4=%7B%7Bcampaign.id%7D%7D "t.thepennyhoarder.com") has compiled all sorts of quick cash tasks from about a dozen advertisers and market research companies thirsty for more data. Freecash has paid out over $13 million to users since 2019.

You can pick and choose your tasks and complete them at your convenience. The coins you earn from each completed task can be converted into Visa gift cards, Amazon gift cards, cryptocurrency, or cold-hard PayPal cash.

Signing up for a Freecash account is easy, and there’s no minimum amount you need to earn before you can cash out. And if you’ve got enough free time on your hands, you can join the ranks of Freecash users making more than $1,000 a month in extra cash.

[Sign up here](https://t.thepennyhoarder.com/aff_ad?campaign_id=316&aff_id=114&source=overspending-desktop-quora&aff_sub3=overspending-desktop-promoted-answer&aff_sub4=%7B%7Bcampaign.id%7D%7D "t.thepennyhoarder.com") to see how much you could earn.

4\. Internet: Get One Month of Free Internet (and a Cheaper High-Speed Internet Bill After That)

There are some bills you just can’t avoid. For most of us, that includes our internet bill. You can’t exactly go without it these days, and your provider knows that — that’s why so many of us are overpaying.

But with [t.thepennyhoarder.com](https://t.thepennyhoarder.com/aff_c?offer_id=7201&aff_id=114&source=overspending-desktop-quora&aff_sub3=overspending-desktop-promoted-answer&aff_sub4=%7B%7Bcampaign.id%7D%7D "t.thepennyhoarder.com") [T-Mobile](https://t.thepennyhoarder.com/aff_c?offer_id=7201&aff_id=114&source=overspending-desktop-quora&aff_sub3=overspending-desktop-promoted-answer&aff_sub4=%7B%7Bcampaign.id%7D%7D "t.thepennyhoarder.com"), you can get high-speed, 5G home internet for as little as $35 a month. They’ll even guarantee to lock in your price.

You’re probably thinking there’s some catch, but they’ll let you try it out for 15 days to see if you like it. If not, you’ll get your money back. You don’t even have to worry about breaking up with your current provider — T-Mobile will pay up to $750 in termination fees.

Even better? When you switch now, you’ll get $150 back via prepaid MasterCard.

Just [enter your address and phone number here](https://t.thepennyhoarder.com/aff_c?offer_id=7201&aff_id=114&source=overspending-desktop-quora&aff_sub3=overspending-desktop-promoted-answer&aff_sub4=%7B%7Bcampaign.id%7D%7D "t.thepennyhoarder.com") to see if you qualify. You could be paying as low as $40 a month for high-speed internet.

5\. Entertainment: Get Paid Up to $140/Month Just for Sharing Your Honest Opinion

If you’re turning blue in the face waiting for a raise at work, it might be time to quit holding your breath and start speaking your mind to someone who wants to listen.

Brands want to hear your opinion to help inform their business decisions on everything from products and services to logos and ads — and they’re willing to pay you up to $140 a month for it.

A free site called [Branded Surveys](https://t.thepennyhoarder.com/aff_c?offer_id=6653&aff_id=114&source=overspending-desktop-quora&aff_sub3=overspending-desktop-promoted-answer&aff_sub4=%7B%7Bcampaign.id%7D%7D "t.thepennyhoarder.com") will pay you up to $5 per survey for sharing your thoughts with their brand partners. Taking three quick surveys a day could earn up to $140 each month.

It takes just a minute to create a free account and start getting paid to speak your mind. Most surveys take five to 15 minutes, and you can check how long they’ll take ahead of time.

And you don’t need to build up tons of money to cash out, either — once you earn $5, you can cash out via PayPal, your bank account, a gift card or Amazon. You’ll get paid within 48 hours of your payout being processed, just for sharing your opinions.

They’ve already paid users more than $20 million since 2012, and the most active users can earn a few hundred dollars a month. Plus, they’ve got an “excellent” rating on Trustpilot.

It takes just a minute to [t.thepennyhoarder.com](https://t.thepennyhoarder.com/aff_c?offer_id=6653&aff_id=114&source=overspending-desktop-quora&aff_sub3=overspending-desktop-promoted-answer&aff_sub4=%7B%7Bcampaign.id%7D%7D "t.thepennyhoarder.com") [set up your account and start getting paid to take surveys](https://t.thepennyhoarder.com/aff_c?offer_id=6653&aff_id=114&source=overspending-desktop-quora&aff_sub3=overspending-desktop-promoted-answer&aff_sub4=%7B%7Bcampaign.id%7D%7D "t.thepennyhoarder.com"). Plus, right now, you’ll get a free 100-point welcome bonus just for becoming part of the community.

6\. Interest: Stop Paying Your Credit Card Company

If you have credit card debt, you know. The anxiety, the interest rates, the fear you’re never going to escape…

And the truth is, your credit card company doesn’t really care. It’s just getting rich by ripping you off with high interest rates — some up to 36%. But a website called [t.thepennyhoarder.com](https://t.thepennyhoarder.com/aff_c?offer_id=6370&aff_id=114&source=overspending-desktop-quora&aff_sub3=overspending-desktop-promoted-answer&aff_sub4=%7B%7Bcampaign.id%7D%7D "t.thepennyhoarder.com") [AmOne](https://t.thepennyhoarder.com/aff_c?offer_id=6370&aff_id=114&source=overspending-desktop-quora&aff_sub3=overspending-desktop-promoted-answer&aff_sub4=%7B%7Bcampaign.id%7D%7D "t.thepennyhoarder.com") wants to help.

If you owe your credit card companies $100,000 or less, AmOne will match you with a low-interest loan you can use to pay off every single one of your balances.

The benefit? You’ll be left with one bill to pay each month. And because personal loans have lower interest rates (AmOne rates start at 6.40% APR), you’ll get out of debt that much faster. Plus: No credit card payment this month.

You don’t need a perfect credit score to get a loan — and comparing your options won’t affect your score at all. Plus, AmOne keeps your information confidential and secure, which is probably why after 20 years in business, it still has an A+ rating with the Better Business Bureau.

It takes less than a minute and just 10 questions to [t.thepennyhoarder.com](https://t.thepennyhoarder.com/aff_c?offer_id=6370&aff_id=114&source=overspending-desktop-quora&aff_sub3=overspending-desktop-promoted-answer&aff_sub4=%7B%7Bcampaign.id%7D%7D "t.thepennyhoarder.com") [see what loans you qualify for](https://t.thepennyhoarder.com/aff_c?offer_id=6370&aff_id=114&source=overspending-desktop-quora&aff_sub3=overspending-desktop-promoted-answer&aff_sub4=%7B%7Bcampaign.id%7D%7D "t.thepennyhoarder.com")— you don’t even need to enter your Social Security number. You do need to give AmOne a real phone number in order to qualify, but don’t worry — they won’t spam you with phone calls.

7\. Wasting Time: Get Paid $225/Month While Watching Movie Previews

If we told you that you could get paid while watching videos on your computer, you’d probably laugh.

It’s too good to be true, right?

But we’re serious. By signing up for a free account with [InboxDollars](https://t.thepennyhoarder.com/aff_c?offer_id=3421&aff_id=114&source=overspending-desktop-quora&aff_sub3=overspending-desktop-promoted-answer&aff_sub4=%7B%7Bcampaign.id%7D%7D "t.thepennyhoarder.com"), you could add up to $225 a month to your pocket. They’ll send you short surveys every day, which you can fill out while you watch someone bake brownies or catch up on the latest Kardashian drama.

No, InboxDollars won’t replace your full-time job, but it’s something easy you can do while you’re already on the couch tonight, wasting time on your phone.

Unlike other sites, InboxDollars pays you in cash — no points or gift cards. It’s already paid its users more than $56 million.

Signing up takes about one minute, and you’ll immediately receive [t.thepennyhoarder.com](https://t.thepennyhoarder.com/aff_c?offer_id=3421&aff_id=114&source=overspending-desktop-quora&aff_sub3=overspending-desktop-promoted-answer&aff_sub4=%7B%7Bcampaign.id%7D%7D "t.thepennyhoarder.com") [a $5 bonus](https://t.thepennyhoarder.com/aff_c?offer_id=3421&aff_id=114&source=overspending-desktop-quora&aff_sub3=overspending-desktop-promoted-answer&aff_sub4=%7B%7Bcampaign.id%7D%7D "t.thepennyhoarder.com") to get you started.

8\. Credit Cards: $10K or More in Debt? Most People Don’t Realize This Option Exists

You’re not an extravagant spender. That’s why it feels so surreal to be in so much debt.

But with higher inflation and rising costs of everyday purchases, so many of us have had to rely more and more on credit cards just to keep up with just our basic needs.

The good news is, a company called [National Debt Relief](https://t.thepennyhoarder.com/aff_c?offer_id=7042&aff_id=114&source=overspending-desktop-quora&aff_sub3=overspending-desktop-promoted-answer&aff_sub4=%7B%7Bcampaign.id%7D%7D "t.thepennyhoarder.com") wants to help by negotiating with your creditors to resolve your debt.

If you owe at least $10,000 in unsecured debt (credit card debt, personal loans, medical bills, etc.), National Debt Relief’s experts can set you up with a realistic timeframe and payment plan that works for you.

As your monthly payments with the National Debt Relief program add up, they’ll negotiate with your creditors to settle your accounts. You will have to pay a percentage of debt settled, but it’ll still be way less than your original debt.

On average, you could resolve your debts in as little as 24 to 48 months.

National Debt Relief is one of the largest debt settlement companies in the nation, and has already helped more than 500,000 people.

Find out what your best options are for taking control of your debt and re-establishing your financial stability. It only takes a few minutes to [t.thepennyhoarder.com](https://t.thepennyhoarder.com/aff_c?offer_id=7042&aff_id=114&source=overspending-desktop-quora&aff_sub3=overspending-desktop-promoted-answer&aff_sub4=%7B%7Bcampaign.id%7D%7D "t.thepennyhoarder.com") [sign up for a free consultation](https://t.thepennyhoarder.com/aff_c?offer_id=7042&aff_id=114&source=overspending-desktop-quora&aff_sub3=overspending-desktop-promoted-answer&aff_sub4=%7B%7Bcampaign.id%7D%7D "t.thepennyhoarder.com").
