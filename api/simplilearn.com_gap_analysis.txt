Jeff Bezos started the company in Washington, USA on July 05, 1994. He was the CEO of the company till July 2021. Andy Jassy took over as the President and CEO of Amazon on July 05 2021.

The first success for Amazon came along very quickly. It began as an online bookstore and kept adding to what it could do. In 1997, the company went public and is now on the NASDAQ in the US. Without help from the press, the company could sell books in 45 countries in less than two months. Amazon is now in more than 200 countries, and its website sells almost everything.

## The 4Ps of Amazon's Marketing Strategy

Amazon looks at the " [marketing mix](https://www.simplilearn.com/incorporating-mobile-marketing-strategy-mix-article "marketing mix")" of a company or brand, which comprises the 4Ps -

1. Product
2. Price
3. Place
4. Promotion

Here is a comprehensive explanation of each factor's function.

### Product

Amazon used only to sell books online, but now it sells millions of different products in many categories. Shoes, jewelry, clothes, toys, home and kitchen appliances, electronics, books, the great outdoors, sports, car accessories, and works of art are some of the most popular products. Amazon sells goods from small businesses and shops but promotes its [brand](https://www.simplilearn.com/elements-of-a-brand-or-brand-persona-article "brand"), Amazon Basics.

### Price

A company can price its products in several different ways. Here are some to remember:

- Cost-plus pricing
- Value pricing
- Competitor pricing
- Price discrimination

Amazon often uses a pricing strategy called "competitive pricing," in which it looks at the prices of its competitors and bases its prices on those. It helps keep costs low and gives customers a lot of choices.

Amazon also uses the following methods to set prices:

- Promotional pricing
- Behavioral pricing

Amazon can change its products daily because of how it runs its business. This is its best feature, making it hard for other companies to compete with Amazon.

### 3\. Place

Amazon's online store has grown over the past few years in many parts of the world. Millions of products are now more accessible to customers worldwide to get. Even if you live in a remote part of the world, you can get packages quickly from Amazon. Part of the company's success comes from the fact that it ships fast and has fulfillment hubs.

### 4\. Promotion

When it comes to marketing, Amazon knows how important communication is. It uses a lot of different kinds of advertising to reach people who might buy or use its products. Amazon has a lot of sales and discounts, which is a great way to build its brand. It has regular ads on websites, newspapers, TV, billboards, and [social media](https://www.simplilearn.com/importance-of-social-media-in-todays-world-article "social media"), among other places. There are also affiliate sites that work with Amazon.
