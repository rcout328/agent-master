Based on the provided text, creating a precise ICP for iPhone customers is challenging due to the limited information. The text focuses on Apple's overall brand success and revenue streams rather than detailed customer profiles.  However, we can infer some characteristics:

**DEMOGRAPHICS:**

* **Location:** Global (Explicit). The text mentions global sales figures, indicating a worldwide customer base.  However, specific regional concentrations would require additional data.
