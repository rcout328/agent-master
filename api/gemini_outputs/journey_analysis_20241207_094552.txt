## 100xEngineers Customer Journey Analysis

Based on the provided HTML snippets, we can infer some aspects of the 100xEngineers customer journey, but a complete analysis requires access to more comprehensive data such as website analytics, customer surveys, and sales data.  The snippets reveal the use of Framer for website development, suggesting a focus on visual appeal and user experience.  The presence of Google Analytics and other tracking tools indicates a data-driven approach, though the specifics are not available here.

**Pre-Purchase Journey**

**Awareness Phase:**

* **How do customers first learn about 100xEngineers?** (Inferred)  The meta descriptions and title tags suggest SEO optimization ("Become GenerativeAI Wizard," "NOT another ChatGPT course").  This implies a reliance on organic search. Social media marketing is likely given the inclusion of Facebook and Twitter meta tags.  Referrals might play a role, but there's no direct evidence in the provided data.
* **What marketing channels are most effective?** (Inferred)  Without data on conversion rates from each channel, it's impossible to definitively state which channels are most effective. However, a likely strong candidate is organic search given the optimized meta tags.

**Research Phase:**

* **What information do customers seek?** (Inferred)  The course description ("NOT another ChatGPT course - this is the real deal. Actual GenerativeAI Engineering!") highlights the course's unique selling proposition, suggesting that customers research alternatives and seek assurances of quality and practical application.
* **Which websites/platforms?** (Inferred)  Given the target audience (likely tech professionals), customers might research on platforms like Reddit, LinkedIn, industry blogs, and comparison websites reviewing online courses.


**Consideration Phase:**

* **Influencing factors:** (Inferred) Brand reputation (though not established from the data), perceived course quality (implied by the description), price, and competitor offerings are key influencers.  Reviews and testimonials would be highly influential factors, yet are absent in provided data.
* **Main competitors:** (Inferred)  The course description directly positions 100xEngineers against ChatGPT courses.  Other competitors are likely other Generative AI engineering courses from platforms like Coursera, Udemy, etc.  100xEngineers differentiates itself by promising "Actual GenerativeAI Engineering," implying a more hands-on, practical approach compared to theory-heavy alternatives.

**Purchase Experience**
