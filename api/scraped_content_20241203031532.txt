## How to list your products on Amazon.in?

### Listing your first product

To start selling your product on Amazon.in you first need to list it on Amazon.in. You can provide your product information such as the product category, brand name, product features and specifications, product images, and price. All these details are available to your customer to help them purchase your product (as shown here).

Set up your product page to start selling. You can edit product details from the ‘Manage Inventory’ section of your Seller Central dashboard.

![How to list your products](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/G/01/sp-marketing-toolkit/guides/design/illustration/Vignettes/Desktop-Products.svg)

### Performance metrics (and why they matter)

- Measure business performance through sales dashboard and reports.
- Ensure compliance with Amazon.in policies.
- Monitor product reviews through feedback manager.
- Use the voice of the customer to identify any highlighted product issue.

You can keep tabs on your performance on Seller Central and make sure you’re meeting your targets.

To manage returns, go to ‘Return Reports’ under the Reports section. Track your return shipments and refunds. Or you can join FBA for a hassle-free experience.

How do I make products more visible?

You can get more visibility to your products by:

- Using relevant keywords - Include keywords in your product title that people type in while searching to get on their top search list.
- Advertising - Activate Sponsored Product ads to make your product appear at multiple places.

How do I make sure my customers don’t buy a fake or counterfeit product?

Amazon.in has initiated a Transparency Program to identify fake products. All you need to do is register in the program and get Transparency codes for your products.

What is the Offer Display?

Offer Display is the box on the right side of an Amazon.in product, from where a customer can buy or add it to their cart. Since there can be multiple sellers selling the same product category, the Offer Display goes to one seller only, for which they need to compete on certain parameters and win.
