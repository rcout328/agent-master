# Amazon ranks No.1 for value and selection in the latest American Customer Satisfaction Index (ACSI)

Written by Amazon Staff

![An image of two hands holding a tablet that shows Amazon.com best sellers. ](https://assets.aboutamazon.com/d9/a5/e93b4a8940338c5f722ba7e67203/customersatisfactionindex-hero.jpg)

The ACSI is an objective measure of customer satisfaction. Each of Amazon’s achievements in this report is an endorsement from the American consumer.

At Amazon, our retail strategy has always focused on three things that we know matter to customers: selection, price, and convenience. Those three priorities have guided Amazon from the beginning, and still do today.

That’s why it’s so rewarding to learn this week that customers ranked Amazon No.1 across our selection, value, and online shopping experience, and No.2 overall across online retail customer satisfaction in the newly released American Customer Satisfaction Index (ACSI)1.

The ACSI survey also ranked Amazon first in measures such as customer loyalty, service quality, meeting customer expectations, and how likely a customer is to recommend Amazon to others.
